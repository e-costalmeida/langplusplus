### Code of Conduct

If you haven't already, please take the time to read our [Code of Conduct](https://github.com/fibanneacci/langplusplus/blob/master/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md). By contributing, you agree to uphold this code.

### Goals for lang++

 * Add language-programming language combinations
 * Improve method for parsing translation data
 * Make demo dynamic
 * Incorporate machine learning
    * Improve translation accuracy
    * Consider context when suggesting autocompletions
    
See [issues](https://github.com/fibanneacci/langplusplus/issues) for detailed tasks and descriptions.

### How to Contribute

#### Code

We are primarily working on the points listed above, in order to ensure that lang++ runs more smoothly. We are also working on making the online editor demo more user-friendly. These involve HTML/CSS/JavaScript expertise to improve the demo, as well as machine learning knowledge to improve aspects such as autocompletion.
Please use the "demo" branch to contribute. If you find any bugs or potential improvements, please open an issue or pull request.

#### Translations

Please use the "translation" branch to contribute. lang++ currently has 1 language-programming language combination. If you are familiar with any languages (other than English) and programming languages for which translation files have not already been created, please create or upload a new file (in .csv format) in the "translations" folder. Name the file using the convention "Lang_proglang" (capitalizing the language and keeping the programming language lowercase).
In addition, feel free to collaborate with others working on the same language files to improve existing translations.
